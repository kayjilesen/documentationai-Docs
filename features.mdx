## Document Structuring and Hierarchy

Organize your documentation into a clear hierarchy using folders and pages. This mirrors your project's structure, making navigation intuitive.

graph TD
    A[Root] --> B[Projects]

    B --> D[WordPress Development]
    C --> E[Planning]
    C --> F[Design]
    C --> G[Deployment]
    D --> H[Setup]
    D --> I[Customization]
```

## Search and Filtering Tools

Powerful search helps you locate documents quickly. Filter by tags, dates, or authors.

| Filter Type | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Tags | Narrow by labels like `design`, `development` | `tag:wordpress` |
| Date Range | Find recent updates | `updated:>2024-01-01` |
| Author | Search by contributor | `author:kay` |
| Full-Text | Keyword matching across content | `strategy design` |

<CodeGroup tabs="Query Examples">
  ```javascript
  // Advanced search query
  const results = searchDocs({
    query: "website strategy",
    filters: { tags: ["design"], updated: ">2024-01-01" }
  });
  ```
  ```python
  # Python client search
  results = client.search(
      query="website strategy",
      filters={"tags": ["design"]}
  )
  ```
</CodeGroup>
